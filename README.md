# PLAsTiCC-Astronomical-Classification

The goal of the challenge is to classify astronomical objects into 14 (known) + 1 (all of the other unknown) classes using time series data i.e. flux v.s. mjd. After observing the raw data, I extracted relevant features, “absolute energy”, “energy ratio by chunks” and “time series complexity” to capture the characteristics. I then proceed to input raw time series data and the relevant features to 3 models, namely RandomForestClassifier, Multi-layer Perceptron and Convolutional Neural Network. It is shown that the MLP slightly outperformed RFC, and CNN is the worst model due to data sparsity. On the other hand, research shows that MLPs with 1 hidden layer with number neurons in between input and output layer size are often optimal in terms of computational efficiency and model performance. Also, the keeping sizes of convolutional layers small, combined with trial and error to test out the number of filters, help determine the optimal CNN for time series classification in our case.
